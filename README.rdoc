Some important notes

I have commented out the javascript assets in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb because I had to work in Windows, and I was having an issue (I don't remember it anymore but of course I could replicate it by uncommenting)
What YOU should do is uncomment that line. If you don't, most of the app will work fine, but you will not be able to sign out! 
(If you do need to become signed out manually, what you can do is go to rails console and put in CompanyUser.last.destroy, or User.last.destroy, or Admin.last.destroy.)

I had to remove "type" as a attribute of Vehicle because that is a reserved word that is used for refering to relationships between models.

I also had to change the database.yml over to Squlite3 because I'm having trouble with my mysql and I did not want to spend time dealing with that. It should have no practical impact on the app at this point.
